### Point to remember
The goal is not to immediately break into a system but to gather as much information as possible about it. 

**The more details we collect, the easier it will be to find ways to attack.**

### **What is Enumeration?**

Enumeration is the process of **collecting precise details** about a system to make hacking easier later.

### Why Tools Alone Aren’t Enough

Many people rely too much on hacking tools, but tools are useless if you don’t understand how they work. The key is to actively interact with the system’s services to understand how they respond and what vulnerabilities they might have.

### What Are We Looking For?

When we scan and inspect a system, we focus on two things:
1. Functions or services that let us interact with the system.
2. Information leaks that give us more clues about how to break in.

### The Importance of Manual Enumeration

Many tools (like Nmap) automate the scanning process, but they have limitations. For example, if a service takes too long to respond, a tool might incorrectly mark it as closed—making us think there's no way in. But if we manually check, we might find a way to access the system that the tool missed.
