## What is Linux?
- **Operating System (OS)**: Manages hardware & software communication (like Windows, macOS).
- **Distributions (Distros)**: Linux comes in many different distributions — often called "distros"— which are versions of Linux.
- **Open-Source**: Free to modify & distribute (used in servers, phones, IoT devices, etc.).

## History
- **Unix (1970s):** Linux is based on an older OS called **Unix**, created by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at AT&T.
- **GNU Project (1983):** Richard Stallman wanted to make a **free Unix-like OS**, leading to the creation of the **GNU General Public License (GPL)**.
- **Linux Kernel (1991):** Linus Torvalds, a Finnish student, built the **Linux kernel**, the core part of Linux.
- **Linux Today:** Linux is used everywhere—from servers to Android phones. There are **over 600 distros** like Ubuntu, Fedora, and RedHat.
