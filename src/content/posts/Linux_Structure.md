## What is Linux?
- **Operating System (OS)**: Manages hardware & software communication (like Windows, macOS).
- **Distributions (Distros)**: Linux comes in many different distributions — often called "distros"— which are versions of Linux.
- **Open-Source**: Free to modify & distribute (used in servers, phones, IoT devices, etc.).
